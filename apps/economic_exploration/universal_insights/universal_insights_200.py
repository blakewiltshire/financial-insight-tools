🧠 Universal Insight Map — Structured Narrative Layer (Theme-Independent Template)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module defines universal, plain-language insights and bias classifications for system-wide
macroeconomic signals. It serves as the primary interpretive layer supporting AI narratives,
insight panels, macro alignment scoring, and external DSS agents.

✅ System Role:
- Delivers standardised insight text and directional bias for all signals across themes
- Supports AI export narratives, scoring overlays, and structured observation pipelines
- Used automatically when no local override is present in `insight_XXX.py` modules

🧠 AI Persona Alignment Notes:
- Insight functions return:
    • Textual insight strings (e.g., "Growth remains above trend")
    • Bias labels (e.g., "Growth Supportive", "Neutral", "Warning")
- Output strings directly feed:
    • Insight panels
    • DSS macro condition summaries
    • AI persona reflection and export modules

⚙️ System Structure & Compatibility:
1️⃣ **Strict String Matching**
    - Signal names must match exactly the outputs from `indicator_map_XXX.py` functions.
    - No inference or dynamic mapping allowed.

2️⃣ **Bias Labels Aligned to Scoring Framework**
    - Valid bias tags: `"Growth Supportive"`, `"Neutral"`, `"Contraction Warning"`
    (or approved equivalents)

3️⃣ **Dispatcher Consistency**
    - Interface includes:
        - `indicator` (signal key)
        - `value` (signal string)
        - `timeframe` (pass-through parameter)
        - `extra_value` (optional; unused for universal module but preserved for
        interface consistency)

4️⃣ **No Embedded Logic**
    - This module performs no calculations or evaluations.
    - All inputs are fully processed signal strings passed from upstream evaluation logic.

🧭 Governance Note:
- This universal insight map is system-stable and globally applied.
- Country-specific or theme-specific extensions occur via local `insight_XXX.py` files only.
