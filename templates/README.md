# Templates — Signpost

**Canonical templates live next to the apps that use them** for traceability and context.

Primary locations:
- `apps/<app_name>/templates/`
- `apps/data_sources/<provider>/templates/`

Use this folder for:
- Your reusable CSV/JSON schema examples for collaboration, **or**
- A short note pointing to the authoritative template under `apps/...`.

> Keeping templates with their consumers reduces schema drift and makes changes auditable in context.
