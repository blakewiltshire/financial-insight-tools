### ℹ️ How to interpret break-even distance

This calculator estimates the price your trade needs to reach in order to **cover all transaction-related costs**.

Key Definitions:
- **Entry Price**: The price you enter a position.
- **Commission / Spread**: The bid-ask difference or fees incurred during the trade.
- **Slippage**: Any additional execution friction from price movement before fill.
- **Fixed Fees**: Platform or operational fees unrelated to price.

### Example:

- Entry: $100  
- Commission: $1  
- Slippage: $0.5  
- Platform Fee: $0.25  

- Total Cost = $1.75  
- Break-Even Price = $101.75  
- Break-Even Distance = 1.75%

This means your trade needs to rise 1.75% just to **cover cost**, before any actual profit is realised.

Use this to:
- Validate your minimum expected move
- Set stop-loss distance vs reward
- Evaluate strategy efficiency in high-cost or high-slippage environments
