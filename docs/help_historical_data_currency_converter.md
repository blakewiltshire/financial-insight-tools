## 💱 Help: Exchange Rate Input

This is the rate at which the **original currency** will be converted into the **target currency**.

Example:
- If your data is in GBP and you want USD, and 1 GBP = 1.25 USD → enter `1.25`

Reliable rate sources:
- [xe.com](https://www.xe.com)
- [oanda.com](https://www.oanda.com)
- [Google Currency Converter](https://www.google.com/search?q=currency+converter)

This conversion is manual — it reflects a moment in time and does not track live prices.
