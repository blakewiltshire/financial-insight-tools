# 📖 About the AI Persona Reference Guide (FIT)

The **🧠 AI Persona Reference Guide** provides a structured catalogue of role-based AI personas
used across the **Financial Insight Tools (FIT)** environment and the
*Navigating the World of Economics, Finance, and Markets* guide series.

Each persona offers a neutral, role-aligned framing to explore economic structure, market
mechanics, risk, and strategy. Personas provide perspectives — not predictions or advice.

### What this module provides
- Definitions, focus areas, and contextual framing for FIT-aligned personas
- Roles spanning macro analysis, portfolio structure, behavioural framing, data interpretation,
  and financial system modelling
- A YAML-backed catalogue stored at `docs/catalogues/ai_personas.yaml`
- Integration with the 🔺 Triangular Navigation Program used throughout the guides

### How to use this module
- Browse personas to understand how each role structures system questions
- Use the search bar to filter by concept, role, or analytical theme
- Use the A–Z filter for quick alphabetical navigation
- When prompting AI systems, select a persona and adopt its interpretive framing for clearer,
  more contextual exploration

### Troubleshooting
- If no personas appear, verify that
  `docs/catalogues/ai_personas.yaml` exists and is properly formatted
- To add or edit personas, update the YAML catalogue directly
- If fields display incorrectly, check for indentation issues or missing list markers in YAML

### Notes
This module is **non-interactive** and is provided solely for reference and framing.
**No trading, investment, or policy advice is provided.**
