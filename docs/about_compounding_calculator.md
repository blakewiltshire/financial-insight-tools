### 📘 What is this app about?

The Compounding Calculator estimates how investments grow over time through the effects of compounding.

It allows users to model:

- One-time initial investments
- Regular recurring contributions
- Growth at a fixed interest or return rate
- Optional inflation adjustment

This module supports strategic framing of long-term wealth building, savings targets, and capital planning. It is especially useful in conjunction with the Trade Structuring & Risk Planning tools when evaluating the time value of investment decisions.

⚠️ This tool is for structural illustration only — it does not predict returns or advise on investment actions.
