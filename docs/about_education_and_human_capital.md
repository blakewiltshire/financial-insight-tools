# 📖 About Education & Human Capital

This module explores structured signals related to national education systems and the development of human capital.
It covers investment in education, enrolment across academic levels, and skill formation within the labour force.

Rather than evaluating education policy or outcomes, the module frames macroeconomic signals that reflect
workforce readiness, socio-economic mobility, and productivity capacity.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools ecosystem and is compatible with cross-country comparisons
where education and human capital data are available.
