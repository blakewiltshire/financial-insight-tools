# 📖 About Geopolitical Risks & Global Stability

This module surfaces structured indicators related to political, institutional, and cross-border stability.
It enables comparative framing of geopolitical risks, state fragility, and governance dynamics
within broader economic and strategic contexts.

Rather than forecasting political events or advocating specific regimes, the module presents a neutral lens
for evaluating observable institutional volatility and systemic risk patterns.

It integrates with the Financial Insight Tools system and can be applied across countries or regions
where political risk and governance data are available.
