# 📖 About Market Trends & Financial Health

This module offers a structured lens on capital market behaviour and the financial robustness of economies
or listed entities. It highlights trends in equity indices, valuation dynamics, sector rotation, and
capitalisation patterns.

Rather than interpreting market direction or recommending asset positions, the module provides macro-to-market
insight layers that reveal financial system sentiment, earnings momentum, and valuation pressure points.

It integrates with broader macroeconomic and thematic modules and applies to countries or sectors with
sufficient financial market data.
