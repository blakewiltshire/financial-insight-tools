# About Innovation, R&D, and Investment

This module presents indicators capturing national efforts in research, innovation, and
capital deployment toward technological progress. It includes data on R&D expenditure,
intellectual property generation, and early-stage investment dynamics such as venture capital flows.

Rather than ranking innovation outcomes, the module frames the structural components
of innovation capacity and capital mobilisation — supporting analysis of ecosystem maturity,
policy leverage, and long-term growth potential.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools suite and applies across countries
with innovation-related statistical coverage.
