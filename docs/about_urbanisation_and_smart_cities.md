# About Urbanisation & Smart Cities

This module presents structured indicators on urban expansion, infrastructure development,
and the emergence of smart city ecosystems. It highlights trends in population density, transport systems,
housing provision, and the digital integration of public infrastructure.

Rather than offering forecasts or urban planning models, the module frames measurable
urbanisation signals that support analysis of spatial concentration, investment needs, and
technological deployment within cities.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools suite and is applicable wherever urban
development and smart infrastructure metrics are available.
