# ℹ️ Help: How to interpret standard deviation analysis

This summary presents how an asset’s recent price behaviour compares to its historical average over three timeframes:

- 📈 **Variability Overview** — Full dataset (e.g., 300 periods)
- 📉 **Short-Term (50 Days)**
- 📊 **Medium-Term (200 Days)**

Each segment includes:

- **Mean Price:** The average over the selected timeframe.
- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of how far prices typically move from the mean.
- **Band Width %:** Total range of ±1 standard deviation as a percentage of the mean.
- **Z-Score (Current Price):** Indicates how far today’s price is from the average in standard deviation units.

---

**How to interpret:**

- A **Z-Score near 0** means the price is close to its historical mean.
- A **Z-Score above ±1** suggests a moderate divergence — useful for buffer or distance-to-target planning.
- A **high Band Width %** signals wider price swings — a more volatile asset or regime.
- A **low Band Width %** may reflect price compression — often associated with tightening conditions or lower realised volatility.

**Example:**

For Tesla (Short-Term):

- **Mean:** $275
- **Std Dev:** $36
- **Z-Score:** 1.83
- **Band Width %:** 13.15%

→ The current price is moderately above the short-term mean, nearing the top of a 1σ range.
This may influence how tight or wide to set planning buffers — especially if seeking a directional
move with defined reward-to-risk logic.
