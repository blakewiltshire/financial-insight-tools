# ⚠️ Value at Risk (VaR) Calculator

This module estimates potential downside exposure of an asset over a given holding period and confidence level.

It supports:

- Single-asset historical VaR calculations.
- Adjustable risk settings (confidence level and holding duration).
- Visualisation of daily returns and statistical thresholds.
- Summary panels showing estimated VaR and potential losses.

The tool helps inform **Trade Structuring & Risk Planning** by framing the potential magnitude of loss under typical market variability — not based on forecast, but on observed return distributions.

**Note:** This app does not model stress events or incorporate forward-looking probabilities. For broader contextualisation, see the *Market & Volatility Scanner* and associated DSS modules.
