# 📖 About Global Trade & Economic Relations

This module analyses cross-border economic interactions and international trade flows. It highlights
national export/import dynamics, trade balances, and openness to external economic forces.

Rather than modelling global competitiveness or prescribing trade policy implications, the module
surfaces indicators relevant to positioning within the international economic system — including
direction of trade, volatility in flows, and exposure to trade-related risks.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools ecosystem and applies across countries with
sufficient trade and external balance data.
