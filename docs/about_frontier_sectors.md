# About Frontier Sectors

This module explores frontier industries and speculative sectors that lie at the edges of mainstream economic activity.
It captures signals from early-stage innovation ecosystems, technological breakthroughs, and paradigm-shifting industries.

Rather than offering forecasts or endorsements, the module provides structured visibility into emerging economic frontiers —
highlighting weak signals, thematic trends, and experimental indicators that may evolve into systemic forces.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools suite, supporting early insight development and
future-framing across investment, policy, and research domains.
