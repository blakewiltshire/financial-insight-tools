### 📖 About User Asset Manager

The **User Asset Manager** serves as a structured reference lens for managing user-defined assets across the Financial Insight Tools system.

It does not provide an upload interface — instead, it guides how to organise custom datasets within the _user asset folders located in the /data_sources/financial_data directory. Once correctly placed, these assets are automatically recognised and made available across all compatible tools.

### Key Functions

- **Directory Reference Viewer:** View available _user asset folders and understand their purpose
- **Category Guidance:** Access descriptions, examples, and formatting expectations for each folder type
- **Cross-Tool Compatibility:** Assets stored in valid folders are automatically integrated into scanners, structuring tools, and calculators
- **Preprocessing Expectations:** Files should be cleaned and structured consistently before placement

### ⚠️ File Handling & Currency Normalisation

All files must be manually placed in the relevant _user folders — this app does not support drag-and-drop uploads. Ensure consistent base currencies across all assets before using them in comparative or structural tools. Use the Historical Data Currency Converter module if currency alignment is required.
