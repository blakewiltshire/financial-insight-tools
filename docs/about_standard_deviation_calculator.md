# 📖 What is this app about?

This module calculates and presents volatility zones based on standard deviation bands across daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes.

It displays:

- **Standard Deviation Bands**: Ranges defined by ±1, ±2, and ±3 standard deviations from the mean.
- **Zone Frequencies**: Historical proportions of observations within each band.
- **Dispersion Metrics**: Variance, range, and standard deviation for each selected timeframe.
- **Return Distribution Visuals**: Line plots highlighting volatility zones relative to price evolution.

The information supports interpretation of historical return dispersion in relation to potential positioning windows, trade planning buffers, or volatility filters.
