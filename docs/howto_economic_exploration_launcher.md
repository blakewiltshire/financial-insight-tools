## 🗂️ About Thematic Groupings

Thematic groupings categorise macroeconomic indicators by their role within the economic system — such as growth, inflation, labour markets, or global trade.

Each grouping reflects a policy-relevant or structurally significant domain. Availability may vary by country, depending on the completeness and granularity of underlying data.
