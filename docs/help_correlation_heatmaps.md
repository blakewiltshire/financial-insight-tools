#### Correlation Interpretation:

Correlation measures the strength and direction of relationship between asset pairs.

- **r = 1.00** — Perfect positive correlation (both assets move together exactly)
- **r = 0.00** — No correlation (completely independent movement)
- **r = -1.00** — Perfect negative correlation (assets move in exact opposite directions)

---

#### Practical Ranges:

| Correlation Coefficient (r) | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **0.70 to 1.00** | 🔵 Strong positive co-movement |
| **0.40 to 0.70** | 🟢 Moderate positive relationship |
| **0.20 to 0.40** | 🟠 Weak positive alignment |
| **-0.20 to 0.20** | ⚪ Negligible correlation |
| **-0.40 to -0.20** | 🟠 Weak negative relationship |
| **-0.70 to -0.40** | 🔴 Moderate inverse behaviour |
| **-1.00 to -0.70** | 🔻 Strong inverse co-movement |

#### P-Value (Statistical Significance):

The **P-value** indicates confidence in the observed correlation.

- **P < 0.05** — Correlation is likely statistically significant
- **P ≥ 0.05** — Correlation may lack confidence (potentially random relationship)

> **Important:** Correlation does not imply causation. Strong correlation indicates relationship, not direction of influence.

#### Rolling Correlation:

Rolling correlation shows how the relationship between two assets evolves over time using a moving window.

- Rising rolling correlation may suggest strengthening systemic linkage.
- Declining rolling correlation can signal breakdown of previous co-movement.

---

#### Pairwise Scatter Plot:

The scatter plot visualizes direct relationship between two asset price series.

- **Tight upward slope** → Positive correlation.
- **Tight downward slope** → Negative correlation.
- **Diffuse / random spread** → Weak or no correlation.

> Clustering around the diagonal lines indicates stronger linear relationship.

#### Summary Insight:

- **Systemic Co-Movement Intensity** provides an overall measure of internal clustering for the selected group.
- **Top Positive** and **Top Inverse Correlations** highlight which pairs exhibit strongest alignment or opposition.
