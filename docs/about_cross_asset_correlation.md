# 🔀 What is this app about?

This module supports strategic evaluation of relationships across asset classes, sectors, and instruments by analysing historical cross-asset correlations.

## 🔍 Key Analytical Focus:

- **Spread Ratio:** Relationship between selected asset pair over time.
- **Correlation Stability:** Rolling correlation to observe shifts in systemic co-movement.
- **Z-Score Deviation:** Degree of deviation from historical ratio mean.
- **Cross-Asset Behaviour:** Identifies synchronisation, decoupling, or regime shifts between asset pairs.

## ⚙️ Strategic Application:

This tool supports multi-asset assessments such as:

- Cross-Market Hedging
- Intermarket Strategy Framing
- Systemic Risk Sensitivity
- Cross-Asset Thematic Construction
- Diversification Validation across non-linear asset classes
