### 🧭 What is this app about?

The **Live Portfolio Monitor** delivers structured diagnostics on currently active positions. As part of the Trade & Portfolio Structuring suite within the Financial Insight Tools system, it supports situational awareness, exposure visibility, and alignment with system-based planning thresholds.

A snapshot of live portfolio positions — including asset, direction, entry price, size, and leverage — is uploaded, along with account capital and structural assumptions. The system computes leverage-adjusted exposure, unrealised performance, and portfolio health metrics across dimensions such as sector, country, and strategic intent.

Common uses include:

- Monitoring active trades across leverage, sector, or capital allocation tiers
- Assessing exposure relative to account capital and predefined thresholds
- Highlighting oversized, concentrated, or structurally misaligned positions
- Reviewing diagnostics before initiating additional trades

### ⚠️ This module does not offer investment advice

Diagnostic outputs are derived from uploaded data and system calculations. Interpretive judgment, risk management decisions, and trade execution remain external to the system.
