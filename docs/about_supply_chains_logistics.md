# 📖 About Supply Chains & Logistics

This module explores macro-level signals related to supply chain health, logistics infrastructure, and distribution efficiency.
It highlights bottlenecks, freight conditions, and transport-linked economic indicators that affect production, inventory, and trade flows.

Rather than diagnosing firm-level disruptions or modelling operational logistics, the module presents a structured lens on systemic
frictions, delivery performance, and supply-side resilience across sectors and regions.

It integrates with the broader Financial Insight Tools system and applies in contexts with reliable freight, inventory,
or logistics sentiment data.
