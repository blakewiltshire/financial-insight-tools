### ℹ️ How to interpret investment compounding

Compounding means reinvesting returns so that each period’s gains also earn returns in the next period. Over time, this produces exponential growth.

### 🧮 Key Components

- **Initial Investment**: The starting capital.
- **Recurring Contribution**: Additional investments made at each period.
- **Return Rate**: The assumed growth per year (nominal).
- **Investment Period**: Total duration in years.
- **Inflation Rate** *(optional)*: Used to adjust the results into real terms.

### 📈 Interpreting the Output

- **Total Contributions**: How much you've put in, manually or regularly.
- **Final Portfolio Value**: How much it's worth at the end, before inflation.
- **Inflation-Adjusted Value**: What that value is *actually worth* in today’s money.

### 🔁 Inflation and Compounding — A Dual Effect

Inflation plays a dual role in long-term investing:

- **Nominal Boost**: Rising prices can inflate asset values.
- **Real Erosion**: Purchasing power declines, reducing the true value of returns.

This app helps separate these effects — so users can see both the headline growth *and* its practical, real-world value.

### 📌 Example

- invest $1,000 initially
- add $100 per month
- 7% annually
- 20 years

- Final Value (nominal): ~$52,000
- Final Value (real, assuming 2% inflation): ~$35,000

This framing supports both savings logic and investment growth context — structurally, not prescriptively.
