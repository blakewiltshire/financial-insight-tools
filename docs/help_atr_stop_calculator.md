# ℹ️ Help: How to interpret ATR-based analysis
This module calculates **Average True Range (ATR)** — a volatility measure showing how much an asset typically moves over a given period.

Each summary includes:

- **ATR (14 Periods)**: Average range between high and low over the last 14 sessions.
- **Current Price**: Most recent closing price.
- **Upper Zone**: Price + ATR — an upper reference level for expected movement.
- **Lower Zone**: Price − ATR — a lower reference boundary for planning.

### Views Compared:
- 📈 **Volatility View** — e.g. last 100 periods
- 📉 **Short-Term** — 50 periods
- 📊 **Medium-Term** — 200 periods

### How to interpret:
- A **higher ATR** suggests wide movement — buffers may need to expand.
- A **lower ATR** suggests compression — but caution for false stability.
- **Upper Zone** ≠ target — it marks a likely stretch range for price movement.
- **Lower Zone** ≠ support — it’s a volatility floor, not a directional clue.

### 🔍 Example:
- **Asset**: Tesla (Last 50 Days)  
- **ATR**: $11.65  
- **Price**: $254.80  
- **Upper Zone**: $266.45  
- **Lower Zone**: $243.15  

A 1× ATR stop-loss would suggest giving a long position breathing room down to $243.15.

A profit target above $266.45 may require more than average momentum to be breached.
