# 📖 About Healthcare Economics

This module presents structured indicators related to national healthcare systems, economic resource allocation,
and population-level service access. It highlights trends in public and private expenditure, infrastructure capacity,
and workforce dynamics — with optional integration of health outcomes or pharmaceutical metrics.

Rather than offering assessments of system performance or policy effectiveness, the module surfaces economic
signals that influence healthcare delivery, budget priorities, and access infrastructure.

It is designed for integration within the Financial Insight Tools suite and supports regional or global comparisons
where healthcare data is available.
