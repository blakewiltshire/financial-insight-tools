## 🧭 System Role

This module serves as the bridge between modular analysis and structured interpretation.

It preserves:

- Analytical discipline
- Context integrity
- Cross-module coherence
- Vendor-neutral AI portability

No direct API calls are made from within the application.
Insight bundles are intentionally model-agnostic and designed for use in external AI environments of your choice.

### ⚠️ Advisory Boundary

This module supports structured planning and diagnostic exploration only.

It does not:

- Provide investment advice
- Generate trading signals
- Issue recommendations
- Execute transactions

Interpretation, scenario framing, and execution decisions remain the responsibility of the end user.
