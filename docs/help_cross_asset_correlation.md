The **Cross-Asset Correlation Module** evaluates the relationship between two distinct assets, sectors, or classes over time. Understanding these outputs helps assess systemic exposure, hedging effectiveness, or intermarket sensitivities.

## 🔢 Key Metrics Explained:

### Spread Ratio

- Shows the price ratio between Asset 1 and Asset 2.
- Allows detection of divergence, regime shifts, or stretched conditions.

### Z-Score Deviation

- Measures how far the current spread ratio deviates from its historical average.
- Useful for identifying potential mean-reversion opportunities or persistent divergence.

### Correlation Coefficient

- Measures the strength and direction of co-movement:
    - **+1.0:** Perfect positive alignment (move together).
    - **0.0:** No significant relationship.
    - **-1.0:** Perfect inverse movement (move opposite).
- The rolling correlation plot helps observe **stability** or **instability** in the relationship over time.

## ⚠️ Interpretation Cautions:

- High correlation does not imply causation.
- Shifts in rolling correlation may signal:
    - Macro regime changes
    - Policy influences
    - Market stress events
- Use cross-asset correlation as a *structural lens*, not a predictive tool.

## 🔬 Application Perspective:

- This tool complements other modules such as:
    - 📉 Spread & Ratio Insights (pairs and spread-based micro-relationships)
    - 🔎 Market & Volatility Scanner (primary asset to reference market correlations)
    - 🌍 Economic Exploration (macro-economic drivers)

Cross-Asset Correlation helps map the **interconnected fabric** of global markets.
