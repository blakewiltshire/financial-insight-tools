# 📖 About Sustainability & Green Economy

This module enables structured exploration of economic-environmental interactions through indicators
linked to sustainability, decarbonisation, and the evolving green economy. It presents metrics such as
emissions trends, renewable energy share, environmental taxation, and green capital allocation.

Rather than promoting normative ESG perspectives or investment preferences, the module highlights
macroeconomic signals relevant to structural transition, environmental policy, and resource resilience.

It integrates into the broader Financial Insight Tools system and is applicable across regions
where environmental-economic data is available.
