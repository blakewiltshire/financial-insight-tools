# 🔗 What is this app about?

The **Thematic Correlation Explorer** enables cross-theme, multi-country correlation analysis across macroeconomic indicators. Rather than narrowly examining isolated signals, this module allows the user to select combinations of indicators across economic growth, labour dynamics, inflation, monetary policy, and other systemic groupings.

The system applies full harmonisation, standardisation, and structural metadata validation to align diverse time series for meaningful comparison. All indicators are internally resampled and standardised (Z-score normalised), allowing correlation strength and directionality to emerge across both short-term and medium-term time horizons.

While not predictive or prescriptive, this module supports:
- Comparative macro framing across countries and themes
- Stress testing of user observations and AI-generated scenarios
- Supporting context for trading, investing, portfolio structuring, and personal development frameworks

**Structural Features Include:**
- Multi-theme ingestion governed by `economic_series_map.py` registry
- Full metadata diagnostics highlighting differences in seasonal adjustments, value types, and unit scales
- Dynamic timeline slicing (50-period short-term, 200-period medium-term, full-history comparison)
- Summary statistics highlighting direct vs inverse relationships across selected indicator pairs

### ⚠️ This module does not offer forecasts or policy recommendations

It provides structured cross-theme, multi-country correlation analysis across macroeconomic indicators. Interpretation, evaluation, and strategic application remain at the user’s discretion.
