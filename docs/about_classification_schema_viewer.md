**Classification Schema Viewer**

This module enables structured exploration of classification systems, governance factors, and cross-sectional economic attributes relevant to institutional, regional, and market-level screening. It consolidates disparate public reference data into a single interactive interface — allowing for strategic review, comparison, and documentation.

---

**Purpose**
• Review country-level classifications (e.g. political stability, forum membership, and market ratings)
• Explore crosswalks between company identifiers, listing venues, and structural classifications
• Support internal verification, schema alignment, and contextual flagging for integration into downstream filters and tools

---

**Structure**
Draws from pre-validated reference datasets and presents the following views:
1. **Political Stability & GNI** — Overlay macro-governance signals with economic tiers
2. **Forum Membership** — Track country inclusion in global or regional governance forums
3. **Market Ratings** — Review sovereign or structural market classifications
4. **Identifiers & Listings** — Match companies with exchange venues, listing codes, and identifiers (CUSIP, ISIN, MIC, etc.)
5. **Company Register – Global / US** — Structured entry points for listed company metadata

Built to assist structural review, ecosystem design, and due diligence across classifications — not as a trading or investment decision tool.
