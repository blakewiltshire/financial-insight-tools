# 📖 About Social Impact & Inequality

This module explores structured indicators reflecting socio-economic equity, distributional outcomes, and
social access across key population groups. It surfaces inequality dynamics and social signals relevant
to economic participation and inclusive development.

Rather than prescribing redistribution or evaluating social policy, the module frames observable
patterns in income dispersion, poverty prevalence, and social access.

It integrates within the Financial Insight Tools system and is applicable across regions where reliable
inequality and social statistics are maintained.
