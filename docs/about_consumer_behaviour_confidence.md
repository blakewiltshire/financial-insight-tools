# 📖 About Consumer Behaviour & Confidence

This module examines household consumption trends, retail performance, and behavioural indicators of consumer sentiment.
It integrates consumption volume metrics, sales turnover, and confidence signals (where available) to evaluate national
demand-side dynamics.

Rather than explaining behavioural outcomes or prescribing demand models, the module highlights shifts in consumer
momentum, psychological posture, and retail resilience across macroeconomic phases.

It supports comparative evaluation across countries or regions with adequate consumption and sentiment data, and integrates
seamlessly with the broader Financial Insight Tools ecosystem.
