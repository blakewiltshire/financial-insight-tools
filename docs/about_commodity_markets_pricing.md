# 📖 About Commodity Markets & Pricing

This module examines price movements, volatility patterns, and structural trends across global commodity markets.
It includes energy, metals, and agricultural resources — surfacing macro signals tied to input costs, supply-demand imbalances,
and trade-linked pricing shifts.

Rather than attempting resource forecasting or speculative interpretation, the module provides a comparative framing of
commodity price behaviours, their economic impact, and their role in inflation, production, or trade dynamics.

It integrates into the Financial Insight Tools suite and applies across geographies where relevant commodity data is accessible.
