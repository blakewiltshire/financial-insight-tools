# 📖 About Inflation & Price Dynamics

This module explores inflationary signals and pricing behaviour across the economy. It presents headline and core inflation
metrics, alongside optional granular components such as housing, energy, and producer prices.

Rather than attributing cause or forecasting inflation regimes, the module highlights pricing pressure directionality,
component contributions, and structural inflation characteristics.

It is deployable across any country with consistent consumer and producer price series, and integrates directly with downstream
policy framing, AI-enhanced diagnostics, or observation-layer tools.

- **Modular Integration**: Fully compatible with other thematic and observational modules within the Financial Insight Tools suite.
