# 📖 About Digital Economy & E-Commerce

This module surfaces indicators related to the structural expansion of digital economic activity.
It presents data on digital infrastructure, information technology investment, and trends in
e-commerce adoption — including payment systems, online platforms, and digital integration in services.

Rather than attempting to quantify total digital transformation, the module highlights measurable shifts
in technology deployment, economic digitisation, and consumption behaviour across online ecosystems.

It integrates with the Financial Insight Tools system and is applicable in any country with ICT and
digital commerce statistics.
