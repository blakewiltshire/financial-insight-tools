### 📘 What is this app about?

The **Trade History & Strategy** module provides a structured review of executed trades and investment decisions. It validates uploaded trade logs for structural integrity and logical coherence, including checks on entry/exit dates, direction, position sizing, and realised P&L alignment.

This tool applies a system-based lens to assess historical performance — supporting workflows where behavioural diagnostics, execution review, and allocation outcomes are central to the decision-making process.

Common uses include:

- Reviewing recorded trade activity for structural and logical consistency  
- Identifying gaps between intended strategy and actual execution  
- Analysing realised returns, directional outcomes, and capital deployment  
- Normalising historical data for export, reflection, or downstream analysis

### Key Functions

- **Status Classification**: Flags trades as open or closed based on exit data  
- **P&L Consistency Check**: Verifies declared vs system-calculated realised performance  
- **Structural Validation**: Detects missing fields, invalid entries, or timing inconsistencies  
- **Output Ready**: Cleaned data is formatted for further review or integration

### ⚠️ This module does not offer investment advice

It provides structural validation and performance diagnostics based solely on the uploaded dataset. Interpretive insights, trade rationale, and strategic conclusions remain external to the tool.
