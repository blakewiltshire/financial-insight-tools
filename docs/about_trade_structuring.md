### 🛠 What is this app about?

The **Trade Structuring & Risk Planning** module enables the design and preparation of structured trades — including single-asset, multi-leg, and leveraged strategies. It forms a core part of the *Trade & Portfolio Structuring* suite within the Financial Insight Tools system.

Rather than prescribing strategies or simulating execution, this tool provides a structured interface for configuring trade setups using real-world asset data, position sizing logic, and capital-based risk parameters. Outputs are formatted for planning, scenario comparison, and integration with the system’s observation, export, and journal tracking components.

Typical applications include:

- Designing trades across equity, CFD, spread betting, and multi-leg strategies
- Estimating sizing, stop-loss thresholds, and reward-to-risk configurations
- Documenting setup conditions, scenario logic, or macro context prior to execution
- Consolidating trade drafts into a structured dashboard for session-based analysis
