# 📘 What is this app about?

The **Kelly Criterion Calculator** estimates the optimal bet size to maximise long-term capital growth for repeated investment decisions where the probability of gain and loss is known or estimated.

It supports planning and position sizing for scenarios where the user has:
- A statistical edge or hypothesis (positive expected value)
- Defined win probability and win/loss ratio
- A desire to avoid overexposure and optimise growth rate over time

This calculator is most useful for structured decisions under uncertainty, such as:
- Systematic trading strategies
- Quant-driven position sizing
- Long-term capital allocation models

⚠️ This tool does **not** produce investment advice or interpret probabilities. It evaluates the **allocation** size assuming the probabilities are valid.

## Key Metrics

- **Win Probability (%):** Likelihood of a successful trade or outcome.
- **Win/Loss Ratio:** Expected profit when winning vs expected loss when losing.
- **Optimal Fraction:** Proportion of capital to risk on each position.
- **Growth Focused:** Maximises geometric growth rate, not short-term wins.
