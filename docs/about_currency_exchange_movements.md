# 📖 About Currency & Exchange Rate Movements

This module presents structured insights into currency valuation trends and exchange rate dynamics.
It includes bilateral FX rates, nominal and real effective exchange rate indices (NEER/REER), and
optionally, volatility signals or policy-linked FX sensitivities.

Rather than speculating on currency direction or trade strategies, the module frames macro-level
currency movements in terms of competitiveness, policy alignment, and external balance pressures.

It integrates seamlessly with other modules in the Financial Insight Tools suite and applies to any country
with sufficient foreign exchange and macro-financial data.
