### 📌 What is this app about?

This module serves as the **entry point for exploring country-level macroeconomic indicators** through structured thematic groupings. It acts as a navigation buffer between the high-level regional selection and detailed indicator modules, ensuring usability even when the number of themes grows large.

Designed for scalability, the launcher supports modular access to grouped economic indicators across themes such as growth, trade, inflation, labour, sustainability, and societal risk — all tailored to the selected country. Sidebar navigation is dynamically constructed based on available modules.

This is not an analytics engine or data visualisation tool in itself — it is a **structural layer for orientation, context, and access.**
