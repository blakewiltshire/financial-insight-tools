# 📖 About Labour Market and Dynamics

This module provides a structured exploration of employment signals and labour force indicators.
It covers headline metrics such as unemployment, participation, and employment growth, as well as
optional indicators on wage dynamics, productivity, and hours worked.

Rather than assigning policy interpretations or labour market outlooks, the module highlights directional shifts,
labour slack, and employment momentum across time. All visualisations and insights are modular and adaptable to local
data availability.

It can be deployed across any country where timely labour market data exists and integrates into downstream macro
signal workflows, AI export tools, or observation logs.
