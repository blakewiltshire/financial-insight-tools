# 📖 About the Index & Glossary Viewer (FIT)

The **🗂️ Index & Glossary Viewer** consolidates terminology, structural
concepts, and analytical references used throughout the **Financial Insight
Tools (FIT)** environment and the guide series
*Navigating the World of Economics, Finance, and Markets*.

Entries provide concise definitions and—where relevant—chapter references and
adjacent concepts that support interpretation across economic, financial, and
market contexts.

---

## What this module provides
- A complete alphabetised reference of terms spanning foundational economics,
market structure, financial analytics, data interpretation, and applied
reasoning.
- A YAML-backed catalogue stored at
  `docs/catalogues/index_glossary.yaml`
- Cross-linking to guide chapters for contextual grounding
- A lightweight, non-prescriptive reference layer for use with FIT modules and
the 🔺 Triangular Navigation Program

---

## How to use this module
- Browse the glossary to clarify terminology and structural concepts.
- Use the search bar to filter by analytical theme or keyword.
- Use the A–Z selector for fast navigation.
- When working inside FIT modules, use glossary terms to frame questions,
compare definitions, or support contextual interpretation.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If no glossary entries appear, ensure
  `docs/catalogues/index_glossary.yaml`
  exists and is correctly structured.
- If terms appear misaligned, verify YAML indentation.
- To extend the glossary, update the YAML file directly.

## Notes
This module is **non-interactive** and supports reference, framing, and
conceptual lookup only.
It does not provide trading, investment, forecasting, or policy advice.
