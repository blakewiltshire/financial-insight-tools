# Data — Signpost

This folder is for **local, user-provided files** (tests, ad-hoc exports, scratch CSVs).

**Do not** place critical shared data here in production.

Canonical, curated datasets live with the apps that consume them for version control and lineage:
- See `apps/data_sources/...` for economic/market templates and curated series.

For scalable/shared setups, consider a database or object store (see *Scaling Beyond Flat Files* in the guide).
